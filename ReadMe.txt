# SMART ZOO
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/N9oDN1744a4
#### Description:
So this project was part of a school project that i had to make so i thought instead of making two projects
I'll use this project for the CS50 final project.

So this app was developed by three people:
1. Me Omar El KAR
2. Sarra Gharsallah
3. Yassmine Gheribi

each one took care of a part of the app
I took care of Animal Management part
At First the app was made in french for my school project but for the purpose of this final project for cs50
I tried to change it to English in the best way i could.

The video contains An "ad" for the app that we had to make for my school project i thought i should put it.
unfortunatly it's in french but the second part contains a demo of the app one is the app when it was french
and the second in english.

The app also contains two arduino scenarios one that i disabled for this final project.
